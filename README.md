1. Given n names and phone numbers, assemble a phone book that maps friends' names to their respective phone numbers. You will then be given an unknown number of names to query your phone book for. For each name queried, print the associated entry from your phone book on a new line in the form name=phonenumber
2. Note: Your phone book should be a Dictionary/Map/Hashmap data structure.
3. Input format: first line contains integer n, number of entries in the phone book
Each of the n subsequent lines describes an entry in the form of 2 space-separated values (name 00000000) on a single line, first value is a friends name and second value is 8 digit phone number.
After the n lines of phonebook entries, there are unknown number on lines on queries. Each line (query) contains a name to look up, must continue to read lines until user types END.
